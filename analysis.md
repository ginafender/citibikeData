### Citi Bike Project Analysis
Findings:
Overall, there was a great increase in bike rides from 2022- 2023. This could be due in part to members feeling more comfortable being in public following the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only was there a great increase in rides, but there was also a noticeable increase in memberships.
Looking at the "Bike Types by Membership" visualization, there is a clear difference between the number of classic bikes rented, comparerd to the number of electric bikes rented. 
There are similiarities between the top stations used in both years.

For bike stations over both years, the most popular stations tend to be in the center of the island. This could be due to it being the most centralized location, closest to various attractions. Many of the popular stations, such as Broadway & E 14 St, remained the top used stations between both years. This could be due to returning members going back to the stations they are familiar with, or a lack of knowledge about the other stations.


Both years see a peak in bike usage during the middle of the week. This finding is counter intuitive because tourists typically come during the weekend, which could be indicitive of long term residents being the main bike users. However, both years see a peak in rides starting at around 5pm.This finding is to be expected, as 5pm is a common time for people getting out of work and having more freetime to take rides.
